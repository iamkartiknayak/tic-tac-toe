# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed in Flutter. It allows two players to take turns and compete against each other to achieve three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid. The game includes a basic user interface and logic to determine the winner or a draw.

### Project Structure
 #### The project structure is organized in the following way:

* lib: contains the main Dart code for the application
* pages: contains the main UI screen
* widgets: contains components used throughout the app.
* assets: contains assets used in app such as images, audio etc

### Features
* Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend on the same device.
Interactive UI: Tap on the grid cells to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
* Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player achieves three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal and declares them as the winner.
* Draw detection: If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game declares it as a draw.
Reset: Reset the game board to start a new game.

### Installation

```bash
